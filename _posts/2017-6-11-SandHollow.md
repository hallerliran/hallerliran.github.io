title: Day 2 Tehachapi to Sand Hollow
---

We spent last night at a very windy campground in Tehachapi, a tiny town in the middle of nowhere in southeaster CA. 
The town is surrounded by enormous windmills - which was a sign of our very windy stay. Raz had a rough night and woke up three times. She asked us if this (ie the caravan) is her house and where is her big house. But she is slowly getting used to living in the caravan - and calls it her little blue home.

When we woke up in the morning we thought we were quickly getting ready and out of there, meanwhile by the time we were done with the dishes etc, many other RVs had already left. Looks like we still have a few things to learn.

Raz has been amazing in the car, and happily sits through four hour drives. She reads, draws, sings, snacks, and plays games. We especially like to play "I Spy with my Little Eye" - althought we aren't always in agreement what the point of the game is. 
Other favorites include the opposite game and guessing what is inside big trucks.

Today we stopped at a water playground in a well off neighborhood outside of Vegas. Raz kept telling an older boy to "Stop spalshing me", but he didn't really care. That was more traumatic for her than the terrible slip and fall that she had while running there (very traumatic for me). She played and played and played, and then devoured a second lunch and fell asleep. 

We ended the day at Sand Hollow State Park in UT, after crossing through both NV and AZ. The state park has a beautiful resevoir, and Raz enjoyed slashing in the water and exploring the fine red sand. On the walk to the resevoir, she kept stopping to pick up handfuls of sand, and said "Look mommy - my handprint" (In Hebrew).

Funny Raz moment - Yesterday in the RV, Raz kept playing with a knob that I told her not to touch. When I was busy doing something else, she suddenly came and hugged and kissed me. I enjoyed it and we cuddled. She then proceeded to go back and play with the knob. I got upset with her and asked her "Raz, what did I tell you?", she came up to me, hugging and kissing and cuddling like before and said "I'm so proud of you". Looks like we have a little manipulative genius.

Raz keeps mentioning Trixy and her friends at daycare. She was playing with a toy ambulance, and so reminded us that "It's like Brandons". And then she keeps telling us "I'm the oldest". I asked her why is she the oldest and so she said "Like Zinnia. Zinnia is the oldest".

Raz today took a shower in the outdoor shower. She loved it!
