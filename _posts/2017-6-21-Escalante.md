title: Day 12 Torrey to Escalante National Monument
---

We woke up today in Torrey, brushed our teeth with bottled water, and got ready to head West towards Escalante. As we were getting ready to leave, Raz was entertaining herself with a shover and pail. She had a bug in her pail and was playing around with it. I told her it was okay to play with it, but not to touch it because we didn't know what kind of bug it was. The second time I reminded her she said "אמא, לכי מפה. אני כבר לא תינוק״.

We got on Highway 12, which is described as Utah's most scenic drive. The way started with green country side flanked by red cliffs and then started climbing. We then entered Dixie National Forest and kept ascending, up rolling green hills covered in a mix of evergreen conifers and tall deciduous  trees with white trunks (still need to figureo out what they are). Leaving the desert behind was a refreshing change of scenery. The climb up on Highway 12 has some beautiful vista points, with views across the valley. We only stopped at one of them, but there are many and they all share sweeping views. Anytime we stop the car, Raz asks ״גם אני יוצאת״ and then is excited when we say that of course she is coming wit us and that we would never leave her behind.

One reason Highway 12 is described as one of the most scenic drives in America is because it passes through many different kinds of scenery. After climbing up the Dixie Forest and crossing the summit of Boulder Mountain, the scenery again changes. It is now much drier and has changed to yellow slickrock, crisscrossed with lines that look like wrinkles or water flowing. One of the scarier parts of the drive is called the Hogbacks, a narrow stretch of highway, where cliffs drop into narrow canyons on either side. Even Liran held his breath (he'll deny it).

On the brief moment when we had cellphone reception, we called Escalante Petrified Forest State Park, to see if they had any available hookup spots. Escalante National Monument is enormous (1.9 million acres), but most of the camping there is backcountry. I think I read there are only two organized campsites in the park (Deer Creek and Calf Creek), and both are dry. We decided that with this heat, we would stay at a full hookup place, preferably not an RV park (which can feel like a parking lot), so we aimed for a state park adjacent to the monument, which also sits on a swimmable reservoir. The ranger at the state park said that they never have vacancies and that sites are booked months in advance. But, for some reason, today he has a hookup site cancellation. He can't save it for us though, and he won't tell us to drive fast since it's a dangerous road, but that we should hurry.

We kept driving on Highway 12, through Boulder. The book says it's a town so isolated and wild that it's still classified as a "frontier commnunity" by the government. I think that's a bit of an exaggeration, with the "health food" store and the coffeeshop. But what is true is that all the businesses essentially close down from November to March because of heavy snow. The town of Escalante is on a similar schedule but I think less extreme.

We arrived at Escalante Petrified Forest State Park and managed to snag the camping spot. As Liran hooked up the trailer, Raz and I went to go pay and checkout the visitor's center. It is by far the tiniest visitors' center we have seen, but also one of the more interesting ones (probably because they invested less in a giftshop and more in content). They had display of various artifacts found in the area, including dinosour bones and lots of petrified wood. On one shelf, they had petrified wood pieces along with letters that people wrote. Apparently, people had taken wood home, but then had mailed it back to the park after having bad luck. Reading the letters was entertaining. They also had a dinosaur footprint, which Raz found amazing. And a taxidermied eagle - she was fascinated by his talons and by the fact he ate snakes. 

After a quick lunch and a nap, Liran and Raz went swimming in the reservoir. Raz was busy pretending to swim and putting her head in the water. By the time I got my act together and joined them, there was a strong wind and it started to rain. We took that as our cue that it was time for a change of activity and decided to head out on Burr Trail. This paved road cuts through Escalante National Monument and eventually reaches Capitol Reef. We only did part of the Burr trail, but it showcases a bit of everything - green pastures, yellow slickrock, and narrow red canyons. 

Driving down Burr Trail, we entered Long Canyon, where we were flanked on either side by tall, sheer red cliffs. We decided to explore an unmarked slot canyon, which we had read about (mile 11, past Deer Creek). The slot canyon was small, starting wide and ending at a narrow V. Raz loved the echo, and was busy playing with the red sand and making rooster and wolf sounds. She is obsessed with wolves (we have been listneing to Peter and the Wolf nonstop), so after howling, she announced I was a wolf and had to catch her since she was Peter. That was the easiest way to get her back out of the canyon and into the car.

We continued a bit longer on the Burr Trail, until the canyon opened up onto a vista of the Circle Cliffs, the Henry Mountains, and all the way to Capitol Reef. It was getting late, so we decided to turn back. There wasn't really any point on continuing on the road since we would have to backtrack anyway.

On the way back, we noticed that the view was a bit hazy. We stopped in Boulder for groceries and noticed a strong smoky smell. We asked around, and turns out there is a raging wildfire west of us in the Dixie National Forest (I googled it, I think they are calling the the Brian Head fire - but there are a few going on). We could see bits of ash carried by the wind floating in the air. 

By the time we arrived at our campsite the air was smoky and it was unpleasant to be outside. It was kind of annoying because the temperatures had dropped and there was a breeze, so it could have been really nice. Instead, we quickly ate dinner and rushed into the RV. Usually, when Raz goes to sleep, Liran and I sit outside and enjoy the stars (which are incredible out here), but today we couldn't stand it. 

It looks like this fire might change our plans. Instead of hanging out here tomorrow and hiking (we were considering either Lower Calf Falls or trying Spooky Canyon), we'll head west to Kodachrome State Park. Maybe we'll be lucky and it won't be as smoky there. Regardless, it's a good hub for some easier hikes in Escalante National Monument, and with this heat, easy is good for us.
