title: Day 21 Mammoth Country, Yellowstone
---

Today we woke up early at the Soda Butte campground outside of Cooke City. No bears. We got ready and headed to Yellowstone. We woke up early so that we could maange to snag a campsite, since we knew they fill up early. We planned to sleep at Tower Campground, which is in Roosevelt Country. Whn we entered the park, the bulletin board said that all campgrounds had space available, so we were optimistic. However, by the time we made it all the way to Tower (30 miles later going at 25mph), the campground was full. We talked to a ranger there who was in the process of buildng another campsite, and he tried to help us find a spot there, but no luck. Actually, in retrospect, it really wasn't an ideal campsite for RVs. Sites were small, cramped, and slanted. 

So we decided to head over to Mammoth Country, where there is a campsite that is always the last to fill up (Indian Creek or someting like that), But on the way we stopped at Mammoth Springs Campsite, which had an opening. Although Lonely Planet said that it wasn't a good campsite, we disagree - maybe for tents it's bad, but it's great for RVs. I talked up the lady at the reception and she gave us a nice, quiet site up above everyone else with a great view (site 52). Mammoth Springs Campsite is only 0.25 mile from Mammoth Springs itself, so we decided to spend our day there.


By the time we finished finding a campsite, setting up camp, and eating lunch it was already noon. We decided on the Beaver Pond hike, a moderate 5 mile loop hike that takes you by a creek, into a forest, and on an exposed sagebrush hill. We had talked to a ranger in the visitors' center and she said it was a great hike and that if we are overwhelmed by all the people in Yellowstone, hiking is the best way to escape. She said most people in Yellowstone don't hike. It was surprisingly true - we were mostly alone for most of the trail, in stark contrast to the throngs of people in Mammoth Springs. The hike itself is in bear territory, and the sign at the trailhead said that two weeks ago a mother grizzly with her two cubs was spotted there. Needless to say, Liran forgot the bear spray in the car. I went back to get it, and after a 0.5 mile detour we were ready go to (and excited to finally see some bears).

As we started the hike, Liran told me to put on my hat. I told him that I would soon, so Raz said "אמא שימי כובע". I asked her ״?מה איתך״ and her response was "לי יש צל" since she was on Liran's back with teh baby carrier and sunshade. Fair enough, I put on my hat.

The hike starts in the woods and climbs up to meadows bursting with wildflowers. I took way too many pictures. As we were walking, Raz pointed out all kinds of things she saw along the way, including finding a fawn between the trees. Every so often she would say "אבא תעצור" for all sorts of random reasons.

The hike then took us past five beaver ponds. There were tons of mosquitos, but no beavers. The change of scenery, from deep forest to open meadow, to pond was refreshing. We had met a family from Texas along the way who were hysterical about bears and wanted to hike with us. After a while we managed to split off from them - at first we were too fast and then too slow. After the beaver ponds the trail climbed again to go up to some more meadows and finally to an exposed sagebrush hill with views of the North Entrance (and we think of Gardiner). The hike was beautiful and varied, but took us 3 hours and felt like more than the 5 miles it was. 

After finishing the hike we decided to go explore the geothermal features of Mammoth Springs. It's a walk along a boardwalk for about 1.5 miles with different springs and formations along the way. We started it at about 4, when we thought there were be less people. It was still pretty crowded, but not awful (the ranger said 7PM was the best time). 

We took our time walking around the boardwalks, which took us by steaming rust colored pools, water cascading over white stairs, and bubbling waterfalls. Raz was walking by herself and asking lots of questions. She was most interested in the warning sign showing a boy getting burned by walking off the boardwalk and into the thermal pool. For about an hour she kept asking me why he didn't listen to his mother and why he chose to be not kind. I tried to turn it into a learning opportunity for her - listen to your mom or get burned. 

At one point Liran remarked that it was very beautiful and asked Raz if she had ever seen anything like it. She said "כן, אצל סבאיצחקי בתל אביב". That girl has seen it all. She also liked that fact that both she and I were wearing ״נעלי ספוט וורוד״ which she then corrected to ״נעלי כושר״. 

After walking most of the way (uphill), Raz decided to sit down and take off her shoes. That was her boycott. So Liran and I took turns having her on our shoulders. But to be fair, she really did walk most of it herself (and it was mostly uphill). When I asked her later why she took off her shoes and socks she replied "ליפעמים אני אוהבת יחפה". I also asked her why in the morning she was whining (she really didn't want to wake up), and her response was "״הייתי עצבנה. Insightful.

This is our third day of dry camping, so I haven't been able to charge my computer. I'm wrapping this up as my computer is about to die. Tomorrow we meet Adi, David and Daniel and will do some sightseeing in Canyon Country before spending the night at Fishing Bridge. Should have internet and power there.

Oh and still no bears.
