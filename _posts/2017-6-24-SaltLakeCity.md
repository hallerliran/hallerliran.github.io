title: Day 15 Salt City
---

Today we visited the Mormons. We left the Richfield KOA after a leisurely breakfast and playground time. At the playground, Raz sat down on the bench next to me and said ״אני אמא. את ילדה. לשחק״. That's a big theme of her's right now. She's the mommy and I'm the baby/girl/sister. Aba also gets to be the sister sometimes.

The drive from Richfield to Salt Lake City was longer than we anticipated. We listened to Peter and the Wolf on repeat for way too long. At one point, when the wolf music came on, Raz announced "זה הטייגר". We told her that no, she knows it's the wolf. She disagreed and insisted it was the tiger. So we asked her how can it be Peter and the Wolf if this is a tiger? So of course, her response "לא. זה פטר והטייגר". Oh, our mistake. Sorry.

On the drive to Salt Lake City I was trying to Google all sorts of things to see and do in the city. Turns out, there isn't much. There are some hipster neighhorhoods to explore with local, artisan crafted jam/beer/cheese/bread and some historical neighborhoods with old houses, but besides the Mormon stuff there isn't anything that's a must-see. So we decided to start off by visiting the Temple Square. The Temple Square is the heart of the city, and is a perfectly manicured area with their temple, two visitor's centers, the church headquarters, the church history museum, and some other buildings. Everything is unbelievablyclean, every blade of grass is at the perfect height, and no flower is out of place. There are smiling, well-dressed young Mormons walking around, ready to strike up a conversation. They aren't aggressive, justreally nice. Everyone is very well-dressed. There is something creepy about the place - as if at night all the Mormons go back to their charging ports and everything gets bleached clean. 

We started at the North Visitor's Center, with a 3D map of Jerusalem. Nice and familiar. We asked one of the missionaries if there were any tours, she directed us to where they meet. They are held every half hour from 9am to 9pm. She then started asking me where I was from etc, and I had to delicated remove myself from impending conversion. We then wandered around the room a bit. Lots of very clean-cut young couples with many children. While they were all wearing dresses and suits and behaving well, Liran was in shorts and sandals and Raz was wearing Crocs and running around and pressing buttons on the exhibits. Raz lead us downstairs to see wax sculptures of the different prophets - Moses through Joseph Smith. They are deeply invested in converting people - there are really comfortable booths where you can sit and watch videos about Mormonism. It's pretty tempting to just sit in the AC and binge watch.

We then went to join a tour. They have tours in Spanish, Mandarin and English every half hour every day. Nuts. We only had patience for 1.5 stops on the tour - the Tabarnacle and one of the meeting halls (I don't think they called it a church). The tour was heavy on the proselytizing - Liran and I found it fascinating, but too boring to hang out for the whole thing. Now that I'm surfing the LDS webiste, I'm realizing that we missed a lot of things because we didn't have patience to stick around. Like a 4 acre rooftop garden and an 11ft statue of Christ. Too bad. 

After skipping out on the tour, we went to go eat at the Cheesecake Factory. We felt it would be fitting with our all American tour to eat there at least once. It was gross. Raz there insisted that I was the baby and she was the mommy. She told me I had to cry. Then she put my head on her shoulder, patted my back, and told me "It's alright, baby, it's already". Then she said "Look, here is your sister" and pointed atLiran.

We then walked a bit more around Temple Square and saw seven different wedding receptions happening at the same time outside the massive church. There is water everywhere. Lots of fountains and streams thorughout the Temple area. We walked past the church headquarters and were surpised by its size - it looks like it should be an FBI or CIA building or something. I wonder what goes on in there.

After a few hours bathing in the light of the Lord, we decided it was time to go back to our trailer park and swim in the pool. This was followed by playground time, dinner and bed.

Liran and I sat outside trying to figure out our plans for tomorrow when our trailer neighbors came by to say hi. They are a Dutch couple who bought an RV in the US with five of their friends. They all take turns driving it around the country, and they are just wrapping up a 6 week trip. They told us that we are doing something with our hookup wrong, which is why the area outside our trailer always smells like sewage. They also gave us a bunch of tips about Yellowstone.

Right after they left, as Liran and I were settling down outside to finally decide what to do tomorrow, the sprinklers went off. We scrambled to bring in the computer, cellphones, maps, books, food etc. After so much drama, Liran's asleep and westill have no concrete plan for tomorrow...
