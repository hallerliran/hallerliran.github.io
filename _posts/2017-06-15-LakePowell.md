title: Day 6 Lake Powell and Antelope Canyon
---

We woke up today in Kanab, UT and had a slow morning. Liran went to get an oil change for the Ridgeline (been working hard!) while Raz and I got ready. Once the Ridgeline was ready we hit the road, leaving Kanab and heading east to Page, AZ on Hwy 89. We passed lots of tiny towns along the way, with names like Big Water and something Creek. The road was beautiful, with mesas across the horizon.

I should have brought a thesarus on this trip, because I'm running out of words. Stunning, gorgeous, beautiful, inspiring, incredible - that's the scale of beauty of this place. The surrounds of Lake Powell look like Mars - sudden cliffs, mesas, blue and purple peaks in the distance. Those surroundsings make for a start contrast with the deep deep blue of the lake. It appears in the distance as you drive east on the highway, and unlike many things in life, it becomes more beautiful as you get closer.

There are only two hookup camp sites in the entire Lake Powell area. Most of the area is devoted to primitive camping. The best campsite, along the river, is called Wahweap. We drove up, and of course it was completely booked. They called the other full hookup campsite in the area - also full. We decided to drive to Page and see if we could find any other full hookup sites. We drove around town and went to the visitors' center, and turns out there really are only two in the whole area. Closest next one is Kanab. So we decided to settle to for dry camping (even though it's 100 degree heat and no AC), and drove back to Wahweap. At least we would be next to the lake.

We ended up getting really lucky - when Liran went to go pay for a dry camsite (one of only 2 remaining), the manager told him he had just had a cancellation, and asked if we wanted a full hookup site. Yes! We are now at a full hookup site (air conditioning, running water, sewer), with a killer view of the lake.

After we settled down and while Raz was napping. Liran and I booked a tour for Lower Antelope Canyon. This is a slot canyon on Navajo land, which means that the only way to get there is with a tour. We booked the last tour availble, for 16:10. But, it was already 15:30 and the canyon was 20 mintues away. So Liran quickly got everything ready, we gently woke Raz and drove over there. We get there, out of breath at 16:00, leaving us exactly enough time to check in. I'm getting Raz ready while Liran goes to check in, and suddenly he comes over with a smile. Turns out AZ doesn't aobserve Daylight Saving's time and we were an hour early! So we joined the earlier tour.

Going on a tour is annoying. Especially with you have other tourists stopping to take pictures and you have to wait in line. But, the canyon itself is stunning (again, need a thesarus). Unlike Zion, which I would skip if it was crowded, Antelope Canyon is worth it. The pictures don't do it justice. Something about the colors and and the light and the texture makes you feel like you are walking in a Georgia O'Keefe painting. Raz got out and walked some of the way, and especially liked running the red sand through her fingers. She told the tour guide "I love sand". When Raz wasn't walking, she was in the carrier - singing songs to herself in English and Hebrew.

After Antelope Canyon, we headed back to Lake Powell. We had heard of a beach with primitive camping called Lone Rock (you can see the rock jutting out of the water). We decided to head down there. When we arrived at Lone Rock beach we were happy that we had our 4x4 car, since there is no trai and you need to drive on deep sand to get to the water. When we got to the water we realized that we were outmatched. There were hundreds of super decked out RVs and trailers setting up camp next to the water. People brind down all their gear and pretty much just live there for a while. They have their fancy grills, water slides, water toys, and games. There were some pretty amazing set ups.

Raz really enjoyed playing the water, and decided that she knew how to swim like Aba. She lay on her stomach, kicked her feet and splashed her hands. A pretty good doggy paddle. She kept wanting to go deeper and deeper, which was terrifying.

We arrived back at our campsite at some hour (it's impossible to know what time it is since we're right by the state line and our cell phones keep switching back and forth), and while Liran made dinner, Raz took another outdoor shower. After that, she sat on a camping chair with a clipboard and markers and drew what she saw - a stunning sunset. She started with a blue marker for the water, then a big green circle for the tree (with leaves) and finally added pink and yellow and orange and purple for the setting sun. We'll hang her picture up in our little home.

Funny Raz moment from yesterday - she was sitting on Liran's shoulders, and stroking his neck. Suddenly, she asks "ma ze hakadur haze?"
His Adam's apple. She is convinced she has one too.
