title: Day 13 Escalante National Monumnet
---

We woke up today in Escalante Petrified Forest State Park. We had intended to do the Lower Calf Creek hike, but were so exhausted from the heat and ash the day before (and weren't sure how bad the ash would be today), that we decided to skip it and head westwards on Hwy 12. Since we left so early, we arrived at Cannonville at around 8:30AM. Cannonville is a tiny town, but it has a decent visitor's center. We went in and the lady basically told us that the weather and the ash is only going to get worse. We're heading in the direction of the fire, so too bad.

We decided to stop at Kodachrome State Park and to see if we could sleep there. It was early, and we had no problem getting a full hookup spot. Kodachrome State Park was recommended as a stop by multiple people (BLM visitor's center, some Utah maps, adn our book), and rightfully so. It was named Kodachrome by National Geographic in 1948 (I think that's the right year), because of the multicolored rock formations. They are white and yellow and red and striped, and really beautiful.

We decided to do 2 hikes today - Cottonwood Narrows and Wills Creek. We were told to start with Cottonwood Narrows because it's a more difficult and exposed hike, so we should do it in the morning. Too bad that by the time we got our act together itw as already 10:30. We arrived at the trailhead at around 11 and started the hike. Thankfully there was no ash, but it was already insanely hot. Also the mosquitos, gnats, and deer flies made it unbearable. The hike was only 1.5 miles, but I don't even think we did the entire route. At one point we decided it wasn't really all that amazing, so we just turned back.

On the way to the campsite, we stopped at Grosvener's Arch - a yellow double arch. It's a quick walk to the arch, which is pretty impressive. And then we rushed back to the car to the AC.

After an unsuccessful nap, we headed out to Will Creek. It was already 4pm, so we thought that it shouldn't be too bad, especially since the hike was in water. Too bad the afternoon winds had just kicked in and had started blowing ash and soot. We started the hike, but realized that we weren't motivated enough to continue. I had had enough of of the heat, the ash, and the flies. So we sat in the shade and Raz played in the water. She didn't care either way.

The air quality here in the afternoon is awful, and even just sitting around you accumulate black spots on your legs from the charcoal/ash floating in the air. On the drive back from Will Creek, we could clearly see where the wildfire was burning and the trajectory of the black smoke. It was such a clearly defined line that it looked as if someone had drawn it. By the time we got back to the campsite around 6, everything had a strange sort of orange glow, since it was filtered through the smoke. The sun just looked like a magenta circle in the sky. 

We had dinner, I put Raz to bed, and Liran went to go explore Kodachrome on some hikes. I'm sure it's a crazy experience with the sunset and the smoke and the stone formations, but I'll pass.

Tomorrow we head to Bryce. Since conditions are so bad, we have decided that we won't sleep there. We will head out early tomorrow, hike, do some scenic drive, and then get the hell out of here. The smoke is just too much to handle. Hopefully we'll still be able to get some nice vistas despite of the haze. We shall see...
