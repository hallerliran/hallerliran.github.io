title: Day 5 Grand Canyon North Rim
---

Today we drove from Zion to Kanab, UT along Highway 89, which leads east through Zion. It is an incredible drive, in between canyons and with sandstone slickrocks and mesas on either side. The drive includes a 1.1 mile long tunnel, built in 1930. The tunnel has a maximum width of 94" - and we were too wide. 

The rangers had to close the tunnel to oncoming traffic to let us drive  through, giving  us full use of two lanes. It was kind of overkill, because we really aren't that wide. I guess it means that they have to go through that whole ordeal pretty much for all RVs. 

At one point in the tunnel, while we are driving in the middle, taking up two lanes, we see a minivan driving right at us. Apparenty someone on the other end didn't count cars properly. The minivan probably was driving slowly in the tunnel and stopping to look at the view in the cutout windows.

After driving through Zion we continued through to Kanab, a small town in Utah. On the way we saw people dressed in long skirts and puffy sleeves - I guess we've officially entered Mormon country. Kanab doesn't really have much to offer in terms of being a cool down, but its surroundings are spectacular. Deep red mesas and cliffs contrast with bright green fields and shrubbery. It's beautiful.

After finding an RV park in Kanab, we unhitched the Ridgeline and headed to the North Rim of the Grand Canyon. It was a pretty long drive, but Raz was amazing. Her new thing is to ask us what songs are about. A song comes on in the car, and she'll ask "אבא - על מה זה השיר הזה?״ somtimes her word order gets confused (for example - " on אמא - על מה זה"?) and then we have to figure out what she's asking. She also loves pointing out things to us from the car. Today we saw bison - so she told us to look at their horns and that they have horns on their heads. She learned that from the ranger at one of the vista points who let her hold a horn from a bighorn sheep. 


The Grand Canyon was spectacular. It was much more peaceful than Zion, and the sheer scale of it was breathtaking. We drove to the North Rim Visitor's Center, from which we did the Bright Angel Point trail. It's a short (0.5 mile trail) which takes you to an overlook over the canyon. On the way there, Raz was in Liran's carrier (thanks Oz!), but on the way back, she insisted on walking. We saw two girls taking a jog along the trail, so Raz decided she wanted to do "כושר" too. She said "אמא, יש לי אוזיות וגם לך. זה עוזר לי לרוץ מהר״", since she saw the girls with headphones and has seen Liran run with them as well. Raz and I ran the rest of the trail (yes, she ran it!), pretending every so often to adjust our headphones.

After Bright Angel Point trail, we did two other scenic hikes/overlooks. First we went to Cape Royal, which is longer drive to another short walk. Raz was asleep, so Liran and I took turns going on the walk. The walk leads to a point called Angel's Window, which is a sort of arch through which you can see the Colorado River.

Next up was Imperial point, the highest point in the Grand Canyon (>8k ft). After that we started the long drive back home. Raz sang songs and played games, but was exhausted. The drive was gorgeous - the afternoon light lit up the sage green fields with gray, blue, purple, and red mesas in the background. We sort of took pictures from the car, but they probably aren't very good.

Today when Raz was exhausted, right before bed, she came up to me, lifted up my shirt, and said "אוי אמא, תראי איזה פופיק מצאתי! אני אוכלת אותו!!״ and then after proceeding to pretend to eat it, she said ״עכשיו אני אחזיר אולו״ and gave me a huge wet kiss.

Raz has also started congratulating us every time we go to the bathroom. As soon as I pee, she says "good job Ima! I'm so proud of you!". She has also started making jokes - for example asking to do things that she knows she can't do, or doing something naughty and telling us "I'm so funny!.
